# WikiGolf

Turn-based WikiRace

[Play!](https://mqnc.github.io/wikigolf/)

WikiGolf fetches an article from the simple Wikipedia, extracts all the links and lets you follow them.

Agree with your friends on a goal article and try to get there with as few strokes as possible.

You can change the start article by appending for instance "?Plant" to the URL:

https://mqnc.github.io/wikigolf/?Plant

WikiGolf is compatible with the Tolino eBook reader!

Enjoy!
